Peer reviewed by: Kenneth Fujimura -- Everything works as it's intended. The inputs all returned what they're supposed to so long as the inputs are whole integers. I like how the function calls ints to pass through but puts out strings. And there's some shortcuts for coding if statements that I didn't know that are useful. Good job, Drew!
